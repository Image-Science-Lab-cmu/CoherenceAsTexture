# CoherenceAsTexture
Simulation code of "Coherence As Texture -- Passive Textureless 3D Reconstruction by Self-interference", CVPR 2024

We simulate spatial incoherent waves from a plane target, and propagate from different distance before the setup.
When target shift from back to from, we can observe interfernce pattern shift from left to right
