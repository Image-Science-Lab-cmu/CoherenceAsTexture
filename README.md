Simulation code of "Coherence As Texture -- Passive Textureless 3D Reconstruction by Self-interference", CVPR 2024 (Highlight)

The code is built on the [holotorch library](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md) and share the same dependency.
We simulate spatial incoherent waves from a plane target, and propagate from different distance before the setup.
When target shift from back to from, we can observe interfernce pattern line shift from left to right, and thus can evaluate the depth.
